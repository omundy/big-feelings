# Big Feelings

<!-- 
Note: The README instructions are the same across the two projects... 

Moving from Glitch to Github:
- You can't have a forked repo and the original in the same account. 
- You can't sync a fork of a template repo with the original.
- So, in order for -starter to be a fork of the original (to sync w/it), the original repo is under omundy/ and -starter (template) is under criticalwebdesign/
